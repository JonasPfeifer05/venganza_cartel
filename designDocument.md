## Introduction

in an story-driven open world map.

### Inspiration

My Drug Cartel puts you in charge of a criminal empire, managing
plantations, staff, and weapons to grow, produce, and distribute
illicit drugs. Starting with a small grow-op, you’ll refine crops,
direct workers, and expand your operation—balancing profits with
the risks of rivals and law enforcement requiring
strategic planning to thrive.

#### [Schedule 1](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/)

In Schedule 1, players manage a drug empire in Hyland Point,
starting with a small grow operation. You cultivate plants,
produce drugs, and oversee distribution through hired dealers
and properties. Expansion increases profits but risks detection
by police and rivals requiring careful strategy to succeed.

### Player Experience

The player start off with almost nothing in an open word and has
to plan his strategy to expand his cartel. The player must learn the process
of producing and selling goods while considering the relation with customers.
